## Running the demos

To run a demo, you need the [Poietic Toolkit](https://github.com/OpenPoiesis/Poietic-swift).

Please refer to a README file included with each folder for more details.

Most of the demos can be run by:

1. Creating a new database: `poietic new`
2. Importing the demo package: `poietic import PATH_TO_MODEL_FOLDER`
3. Running the model: `poietic run`


## Development Notes

The included demos are in early stage of development. The file format of
the demos is not yet stable and might change. If you create your own
derivatives, please be aware, that they might or might not work in the future.
